# Installl PHP Unit Testing
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit

# Alias
alias phpunit="./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit"

How does it work?
* All class name needs to have the word "Test" at the end, for example: class UserTest
* Every class needs to be extended to \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
* All methods inside the test class need to have as a prefix the word "test" like "public function testFunctionExample()"
* Also insted of writing the prefix "test" in methods name, you can write in description method the following:
  /**
  * @test
  */
  public function functionExample()
* In order to check the test for equal value, you can use assertEquals(expectedValue, method($x, $y)
